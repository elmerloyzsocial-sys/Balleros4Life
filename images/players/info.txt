Absolutely! Here’s what I’ll do:

Provide a sample image (as a link to a free placeholder image, since images can't be uploaded via chat).
Modify your script.js so you only need to copy-paste it.
The upload form will be hidden.
You’ll get an example player array including a placeholder image and instructions for adding more.
Sample Image
Use this placeholder image in your images/players/ folder (save it as sample_player.jpg):

Download this sample image:
Sample Player Image – Placeholder.com

Right-click → Save image as... → Upload to your repo at images/players/sample_player.jpg.


Instructions
Upload your player images to images/players/ in your repo.
Add each player's name and image filename to the players array in script.js.
Save your changes and refresh photos.html.
